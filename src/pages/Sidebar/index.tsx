                    <p>
                        GNN Stands for Graph Neural Networks. As its name suggests, GNN is a
                        class of neural networks that operate on graph data, which is a
                        collection of nodes connected by edges. Consider social networks as
                        an example, GNNs can analyze connections to understand communities,
                        predict behavior, or recommend products based on social
                        interactions. Nowadays, GNNs are increasingly used to solve a wide
                        variety of tasks such as model molecules in chemistry, predict
                        protein interactions in biology, or studying citation networks in
                        social science.

                    <p>
                        To start, letâ€™s establish what a graph is. A graph represents the
                        relations (edges) between a collection of entities (nodes). For
                        example, the right panel shows a graph of a chemical compound, from
                        the{" "}
                        <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/graphs-datasets/MUTAG" target="__blank">

                        </a>{" "}
                        dataset. In this graph, nodes are atoms and edges are bonds between
                        atoms.
                    </p>

                        A graph can be represented as either a node-link diagram or an adjacency matrix.
                        An adjacency matrix is a square matrix where the rows and columns of
                        <br />

                        For example, in the chemical compound graph, an one-hot
                        encoding is used to represent the atom type, whether it is a carbon,
                        oxygen, nitrogen, etc.
